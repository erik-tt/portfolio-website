# portfolio-website
This is a short portifolio website about me. The purpose of this small project was to practice and experiment with HTML and CSS. It is created using react, but it could have just been a plain HTML and CSS project. The project was supposed to be larger and therefore it started out as a react project to make it easier to scale and more efficient.

##Run the project
Build the project using npm install and run it using npm start. It should show up at localhost:3000.
