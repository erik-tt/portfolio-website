        <p className="introParagraph">I am 22 years old. Currently I am on my third year of a 
          MSc degree in computer science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology NTNU with a major in software development.
          I have a strong interest in technology and innovation and how we can take advantage of new technologies in companies and in the society.
          I started programming in 2020 and I really enjoy developing my CS skills and learning new concepts.
          I am also interested in finance and economics, and I have always had a strong interest in social economics.

        <p className='introParagraph'>
          I am an outgoing person who loves to work with people. My curiosity drives me, and I love learning new things. On my freetime I like to exercise, be with friends, and work on
          small projects I think is interesting, like creating this website.

      <h3>Computer Science</h3>
      <p>
      Throughout my studies I have learned how to approach difficult problems. 
        I have completed courses in mathematics, algorithms, computer architecture,
        software development, object-oriented programming,
        design principles etc.

        I have gained a lot of experience programming in python and object-oriented programming in java.
        When creating backend applications with java, we have used the Spring framework. I also know how to write SQL and implement SQL databases. The last year I have been wanting to learn more about JavaScript and react for web development and I am going to choose web development as a course next year.
        I have basic knowledge in C from computer architecture and operating system classes.

        The last year I have learned about project management and the Scrum framework. I have used Scrum during two projects where we focused on the processes needed to create good and working software.

      </p>

      <h3>Work and Voluntary Work</h3>
      <p>
        Learning to work efficiently with other people is the most valuable skill I have developed while working.
         I like having responsibility and I enjoy being able to
        influence decisions. During my initial military service, I gained experience in team management as a squad leader. 
        At IKEA I gained experience in sales and logistics. From EWB I worked as an event planner to host events that increase the awareness of
        of aid work, and how we can implement engineering. I learned a lot about planning, communicating with others and how to arrange good events. 
        
        I was not interested in aid before joining
        EWB, but I wanted to spend my free time doing something meaningful. I became more aware of how we can use engineering to help people from less developed countries. After my year at EWB I was encouraged to apply for several 
        board member positions. I took what I learned from EWB and applied for a position in the finance and banking committee in Abakus. 
        I wanted to gain experience with finance, and I hope that I will continue to develop myself at Abakus the next year.
